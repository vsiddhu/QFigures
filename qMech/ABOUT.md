A directory for storing figures related to quantum mechanics. TeX files
that generate these figures are included. These TeX files can help generate pdf
figures. However the pdfs can be converted to ps or eps, for instance using
[Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/). These TeX files mostly use the
[TikZ](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf) package for making figures.
