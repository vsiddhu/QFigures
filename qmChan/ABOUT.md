A directory for storing figures related to [quantum
channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_channel). TeX files that
generate these figures are included. These TeX files can help generate pdf
figures. However the pdfs can be converted to ps or eps, for instance using
[Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/). These TeX files mostly use the
[TikZ](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf) package for making figures.
